  summary: Includes HTML function and methods to write in an HTML file. Thus, making HTML reports is easy. Includes a function that allows redirection on the fly, which appears to be very useful for teaching purpose, as the student can keep a copy of the produced output to keep all that he did during the course. Package
    comes with a vignette describing how to write HTML reports for statistical analysis. Finally, a driver for 'Sweave' allows to parse HTML flat files containing R code and to automatically write the corresponding outputs (tables and graphs).
